<p>L'Enchanteur, <em>or The Enchanter, has been one of the most popular books in the Francophone world for three decades. With brilliant clarity, verve, and humour, author René Barjavel retells the famous legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table from the perspective of Arthur's companion and guide, Merlin the Enchanter. While faithfully and poetically capturing the breadth of Arthur's travails, Barjavel also provides a keen insight into the psychology of its characters.</em></p>

<p>Despite the popularity of Barjavel's tale, <em>The Enchanter</em> has never been translated into English. In the interest of disseminating it for her Anglophone companions, artist Pauline Petit has taken it upon herself to translate the entire novel, and make it available to a broader readership. The legend begins with chapter one, below.</p>

<h3>Biography:</h3>

<p>Barjavel was born in Nyons, Provence in 1911. He went to Cusset jr. high, in Allier. After quitting several jobs, he joined the newspaper <em>Progrès de l’Allier</em> and learnt on the job how to be a journalist. He then met the editor Denoël, who hired him as a production manager. After the war, in which he served in the Zouaves regiment, Barjavel published his first novel <em>Ravages</em> (1943) well ahead of the big wave of science-fiction works. Since <em>Ravages</em>, which has today sold more than one million copies and is studied in high schools, Barjavel has written about twenty novels, the most famous being <em>The End of Times, The Roads of Katmandou, The Tiger’s Hunger</em> and <em>The Ladies of the Unicorn</em> (with Olenka de Veer). He was also the dialogist for over twenty movies, including the famous <em>Don Camillo</em>.</p>   

<p>René Barjavel died in 1985.</p> <br /><br />


<blockquote>
to the bards, tale teller, troubadours, poets, writers, who for two thousand years have sung, told, written the stories of the great warriors, brutal and naive, and of their Dames who where the most beautiful in the world, and have celebrated the exploits, the loves and hoaxes,<br /><br />

to the writers, singers, poets, searchers of today who have resuscitated the heroes of the Quest,  <br /><br />

to all, dead and alive, with admiration and gratitude I dedicate this book that owes its existence to them, <br /> <br />

and I humbly ask them to welcome me amongst them.<br /><br />

<p>Over one thousand years ago a magician called Merlin lived in Brittany.  He was young and beautiful; his eyes were lively and malicious, his smile a bit taunting, his hands fine; he had the grace of a dancer, the nonchalance of a cat, the spirit of a swallow. Time passed over him without a touch. He had the everlasting youth of the woods.</p>

<p>He had powers, and only used them for good, or what he believed to be good. But sometimes he made a mistake, because though he was not ordinary, he was nevertheless human.</p>

<p>For men, he was a friend, the one who comforts, who shares joy and sorrow and always helps. Without fail.</p> 

<p>For women, he was a dream. Those who like fair hair met him crowned with gold and sun; those who prefer dark hair saw him with locks the colour of night or twilight. They were not in love with him, it was impossible; he was too beautiful, too unreachable; he was divine. Only Vivianne loved him. Maybe it was lucky, perhaps it was unfortunate, for them or for both together. We cannot know, we are not magicians. For all, he was irreplaceable, he whom we wish we never have to see go away, but who must leave, eventually.</p> 

<p>When he left the world of men, he left a longing that never healed. We no longer know who it is we miss and we are always waiting; yet we know that there is an emptiness in our heart. ?</p> 

<p style="text-align:center">*</p>

<p>The white stag came out from a bush of hawthorn; not a flower moved. Its fur resembled freshly fallen snow; walking through the clearing, its antlers swung, like sails on a ship.</p> 

<p>Merlin liked taking this form when he wandered the forest. He stopped soundlessly at the bottom of the path leading to the spring of the Eye. It was so-called owing to the fact that on nice days, the sky’s reflection on the basin’s surface (that the spring had dug in the sand and fine rubbles) took the appearance of a big blue eye amidst lashes of mint and forget-me-nots.</p> 

<p>A girl was bathing in it, blond and naked. The stag could see her through the foliage. She was very young, twelve years old, thirteen perhaps. In water up to her knees, she cupped it and splashed it on herself. She was laughing to keep herself from shivering, shrieking, and singing wordless fragments of melody. The sun glistened on her short dancing hair and on the water drops that rolled on her pink golden skin. Her breasts, barely hinting and round, hardened from the fresh water.</p> 

<p>Her long thighs were no longer the growing stalks of a little girl, and not yet the sinuous branches of a young woman. Exquisite outlines full of promise, her slight moving curves proclaimed Creation’s greatest masterpiece: the woman's body, which God made, with his hands, from a piece of man.</p> 

<p>The spring was laughing with her, covering her feet with fresh sand, bursting bubbles between her toes; a green and golden salamander swam around her ankles, came out of the water and stuck its tongue at her; a bark-feathered thrushlet landed on her head and sung just like a thrush. In the sun and in the water, her thin hands danced like two flowers, moved by the wind.</p> 

<p>In the stag’s body, the heart of Merlin was shaking. He knew that he would never see her the same as she was in this moment. Tomorrow, later, she would already be different. She had the piercing beauty of what changes so quickly, what can never be found again. Later, remembering this meeting, he created a rose whose form and colour changes from hour to hour and lives only one day. It still blooms in England. The English name it Yesterday: yesterday... since its present has already gone to past.</p> 

<p>The forest was only silence and bird songs: songs of the spring and the girl, songs of leaves and branches that stretch themselves in the arms of warm air. Nothing of the battle’s thrashing that was going on in the plain in front of Carohaise could reach the woods. Merlin had left it when it turned to the advantage of the defenders of the little city, and when they no longer needed him. The voice of his father had warned him that King Arthur would soon be in danger. It had echoed in his head in the midst of the fight, grating, sneering, as per usual.</p>       

<p>“Poor idiot son,” it said, “here you are, busy assisting this young fool against the Saxons, Romans and Alemanni, but the adversary that awaits him near the Eye is yet more dangerous for him...”</p> 

<p>And the voice went quiet, in a big metallic laugh. Merlin had immediately transported himself to the forest to see who this unknown adversary was, who was going to rise before Arthur.</p> 

<p>And when he discovered this miraculous child, he had understood it was for him his father had set the trap, the worst he had ever set for him. He had ran straight into it, and he wondered if he could ever free himself from it.</p> 

<p style="text-align:center">*</p>  

<p>His father was the Devil.</p> 

<p>Merlin was a creature of God and wholly in His service, but the Devil had spawned him and could not be discouraged from taking him back under his power. He took advantage of every chance that came up to try and make him trip. And when they did not come up, he made them up.</p> 

<p>He had not created this girl, but weaved the loom of her meeting with Merlin, and with Arthur no doubt. The Magician wanted to know who she was - and so he knew. Her name was Vivian, and she was the daughter of a small gentleman who had hardly any land, but who came from a very high lineage. He had descended from Diana, to whom this very forest once belonged. In Vivian’s veins, in the bursting freshness of her innocence, ran the blood and power of the ancient queen of the forest, faded from the world. If the magical child took an interest in Arthur, the latter would be lost for the Grail...</p> 

<p>Merlin had taken charge of Arthur’s destiny even before his birth. He wanted him to become the world’s best knight, capable of finding the Grail, whose absence caused the misery of men. He helped Arthur as much as he could. This did not mean erasing all the obstacles in his step, but rather, generating some which were harder and harder to overcome, so that Arthur may grow. The boy was valiant, bright, gay, full of friendship; he fought without hate, with the strength of a Spanish bull, and had yet not found a master. He had, that day, slain the leader of the Romans Pontius Antony, piercing him through and through, half of his spear coming out his back. And, with his sword, he had cut himself a bloody path to the Duke of Frolle, leader of the Alemanni, whose men had routed and abandoned him. He had turned his horse around and left the battlefield.</p> 

<p>Arthur would be turning seventeen in just three days. He had ascended the throne of Logres at sixteen. He had vanquished the strongest and most skillful knights, and beaten the wildest war lords. Time had come to send him on the Quest. Merlin saw only one way to prevent the Devil and Vivian from making him stumble.</p>
