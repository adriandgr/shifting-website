<p><strong>Why do we conceive of the future in the image of the past?</strong></p>

<p>There is a nostalgic attitude we take towards representations of the future.</p> 

<p>Many of the most popular visions of the future are bracketed with an ironic datedness, because it is virtually impossible to conceive of the future in terms of anything other than the past, or at the very least, a distended present. And so the future often adopts the form of a nostalgic fiction – specifically, science fiction, which conceptually associates itself with the possibilities of the future, or at the very least, alternative presents. Though science fiction is not intrinsically oriented toward the future, the aesthetics of science fiction are a great part of the future’s visual vocabulary.</p>

<p> Crucially, science fiction is defined in terms of its novelty; its meaning lies not in the aesthetic of the world it creates, but rather, the gimmicks which demarcate that world. Yet there is a particular aesthetic associated with science fiction which continues to permeate popular culture. The dangerously addictive website TVtropes.com defines this aesthetic as <strong><a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Retraux">retraux</a></strong>, design which intentionally mimics the dated 'zeerust' aesthetic of Cold War era American culture. Retraux design is commonplace in today's popular culture. Films like 2013's <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/nasas-1970s-vision-of-space-colonies-inspired-neil-blomkamps-emelysiumem">Elysium</a> and Disney's upcoming <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sH0__SpV88">Tomorrowland</a>, bands such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0uqLM1uj_k">Coldplay</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2zKARkpDW4">Boards of Canada</a>, and videogames like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-x-1fm2cq8">Fallout</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7h0cgmvIrZw">Alien: Isolation</a> have all recently employed retraux aesthetics.</p>

<p>Retraux is less well documented in the art world. But two recent film installations in Vancouver art galleries invoked retraux imagery and mediums in their own representations of the future. At the Or Gallery was David Hartt's Adrift, a short 16mm film projection, while at the Contemporary Art Gallery, Jeremy Shaw's Quickeners appropriated mid-century stock documentary footage. Though the films and exhibitions were produced independently of each other, providentially, both artists shared in a similarly dystopic vision: the speculative notion of a future in which human beings are unable to avoid looking at, and re-performing, the past. The result is a re-configuration of the present moment, as perceived through the lens of a history which is itself projected into the future.</p>

<p>Set some time in the near future, David Hartt's Adrift follows a series of phone conversations between teenage protagonists Saini and Noah. Saini lives in New Nanumea, an (arcological)[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcology] Tuvalese refugee community located on the shores of the Mississipi river in Missouri; we are led to understand that the entire population of Tuvalu has been evacuated after the Pacific island was completely submerged due to global warming. Over the course of the film, Saini conspires with Noah to escape the refugee community, and meet him in nearby St. Louis.</p>

<p>Viewers never get to see Saini and Noah, nor is there any formal element in the film which would indicate we are glimpsing the future. The voices – which are themselves nearly inaudible in the installation – are accompanied by seemingly unrelated footage of the island of Tuvalu shot by the artist, along with out-of-focus closeups of an architect's model of the Chicago River City housing complex, and of the interior of the complex itself.</p>

<p>Adrift is projected onto a screen in the gallery; plastic seats of varying shape and size are scattered around nearby, resting upon old rugs, while cables wreathed across the floor connect the film with a wood-paneled amplifier. Visitors are given the impression that they are themselves denizens of a future even further from the present than that of Adrift's, yet still strangely similar to the present; that they have come across a half-forgotten cinematic relic, left in a basement to decay and brought into the (itself antiquated) projection room for a lark. It is as if the film itself is a manifestation of disjointed memory, in all of its fuzzy placidity.</p>

<p>The entire arrangement is a screen, secondary to that on which the film is projected; it shields the viewer from the social and political tragedies that Adrift bespeaks, tragedies which, in reality, are quite palpable and very close. The viewer is blessed and calmed by the thought that it is no longer possible to change what has already passed, and that even if one wanted to critically engage with the narrative, the cloudedness and spectacle of the entire 'document' would make it virtually impossible. We might as well be looking at stock footage out of any number of countless news reports from our own era. Such equanimity speaks to the disturbing level of political apathy that the barrage of news media has helped to inculcate, yet, Hartt’s work does not ultimately distinguish itself from that barrage in any way. Look at the palm trees, float on the seas, and remember the promises of documentaries.</p>

Jeremy Shaw's work is of an altogether distinct stripe, though he operates within the same dynamic as Hartt. Just as the protagonists of Adrift struggle to free themselves from the de-politicized nostalgia of a speculative future, so do the stars of Quickeners strive to regress from a utopian future in which all queries of the human condition have been absolved and negated.

Quickeners appropriates grainy stock footage of an Pentecostal church ceremony, in which participants chant, dance, bait rattlesnakes, and speak in tongues. Yet, a dulcet narrator informs us that we are watching the divergent strains of a human hive body, 500 years in the future. Whereas the majority of 'Quantum Humans' have managed to achieve a collective oneness of consciousness, humans with 'Human Atavism Syndrome' inhabit corporeal forms of existence and engage in non-rational behaviours. Some sufferers of H.A.S. celebrate their aberrations, and name themselves Quickeners. They strive for Quickenings – moments of ecstatic experience in which their bodies are filled with the sort of numinous joy that is no longer available to Quantum Humans.

Of course, the film is metaphorical, even if not intentionally. Just as Quickeners must appear to be misguided and execrable to the sophisticated Quantum Humans, so too do practitioners of Pentecostalism appear antiquated and lunatic to the liberal elite that associates with the artwork of Jeremy Shaw. The analogy produces a conclusion: we are already Quantum Humans; we are already disassociated from the past. This disassociation mimics that of Adrift's screening, insofar as the future presents the present as a fait accompli.

However, toward the conclusion of the 'documentary,' viewers are exposed to several instances of a Quickening. As the Quickeners dance and chant, the voice of the narrator fades into the background; the framerate of the footage slows, and individual men and women begin to pulsate with glowing energy. Surges of droning noise fill the installation, and, for a moment, the viewer is no longer external to the screen. The Quickeners are not merely Pentecostal Christians under a different name; the same force of energy that they experience is immediately present and palpable.

Shortly after, the narrator returns, archly disavowing that Quickenings are anything more than deviations from the perfection of human form. Yet, if we are Quantum Humans, we certainly do not remain skeptics; we cannot deny the existence of irrational, immersive, all-encompassing sensualism, even if we are unable to experience it ourselves. This is not to suggest that Shaw is an advocate for religious experience; this is too blunt of a point. Rather, it is that Quickeners is a breaking through of social narrative. It alludes to the reality of lived experience, outside of historicism; it wants the future (as we 'look back upon it') to be an open possibility of sensualism.

In this way, Shaw's work achieves something that Hartt's does not. Adrift presents a future that has already passed - a future in which questions of sovereignty and ecological responsibility are implacably distanced from any sense of immediacy via the combined cleansing efforts of a nostalgic installation and the soothing bricolage of documentarian cinema. Quickeners attempts to break apart this future via an act of subterfuge against the representation of the past; in other words, Shaw’s work spits upon Retraux aesthetics, which makes the future into a charming past, and denies anyone in the present their own agency.
