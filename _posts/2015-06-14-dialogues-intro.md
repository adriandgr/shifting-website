<h3>Introduction to Dialogues on <em>Art is Performance</em></h3>

<p><strong>BUCCI:</strong> I'd like to start a discussion here about art as performance, since we've been talking about it, and I think it's a really important concept. </p>

<p>This is a concept we brought up during our Processed exhibition, and something I've been working on by myself. I was quite delighted to see that someone actually wrote a book about this, reviewed here: <a href="http://www.uqtr.ca/AE/Vol_13/recension/Bicknell.html">David Davies, Art as Performance</a>. I've ordered the book, but I figured I'd start by getting my initial thoughts on paper, before I've done any heavy scholarship.</p>

<br />

<h3>First Thoughts On Art As Performance</h3>

<p>It's quite often that I hear artists being asked, "So what is it that you do?" This is a good question. This is an existentially critical question for those who consider themselves to be artists yet have no craft, and typically one that has no satisfying resolution. A painter can say that they make paintings. A songwriter can say that they write songs. A conceptual artist can, at best, say that they create opportunities for an artistic experience, either for their own experience or for the public. Occasionally they will fix their art in a medium, but then their artistic self-signification becomes a laundry list: "Oh, I do video works, some performance, digital stuff, photos, collage.” Or a simple approximation of their current endeavors: “I'm really into net art right now."</p>

<p>IDon't let this read as derisive, or at least not completely. To arbitrarily fix art in a craft is to miss the point of art making. Yet, articulating what that point actually is presents some difficulties. The 'point' of art is inextricable from the valuation of art, and there is no single metric that presents itself as most important. It could be the aesthetic experience. It could be the reputation of the artist. It could be the amount of time put into a piece. The level of skill involved in its production. Novelty. Excitement. Allegorical robustness. Art-historical grounding.</p>

<p>IIn the summer of 2013, while producing our show Processed for The Shifting we remarked that none of us particularly considered our final shown works as the place where the art-part was. That is to say that the meaning and value of the works laid not in the object produced, but in the act of production. The works were traces of the production process, and stood more as monuments to our personal artistic experiences. My own work was made in part as a response to Sol LeWitt. I felt that my job as an artist was to take Sol LeWitt seriously, and work through his ideas responsibly. The art didn't happen when I printed the final piece. The art happened in a hotel room in Saskatchewan while I tried to decipher his parallelogram production algorithm—everything after that was just cleaning up my work so that someone else could read it. Rhys Edwards, a painter, and therefore a person who can point quite clearly to an object and say "that is my art," similarly did not consider his paintings to be the art object, but more the fixed representation of his time spent playing through Grand Theft Auto and working through his ideas.</p>

<p>IThat idea of fixing our time spent has an economic analogue. Congealing the artistic process in an object is like locating utility in some commodity through work.</p>

<p>IIt could be that we value the belief that the artist has attained a state that is inaccessible to us. Or our own experience, using the artist's object as a vector. Further, what does it mean to locate value? It's worth noting that there can be a categorical difference in the scope of a value statement: value could be determined as a property of a system/subsystem interaction or an object in relation to a system. Put another way: to what extent can we say the value is in the object?</p>
