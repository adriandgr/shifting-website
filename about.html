<p>The Shifting is a friendly unit of artists making work collectively in Vancouver BC. We engage with local discourses through public performance, installations and writing. Our art critically examines systems of presentation and representation as they relate to different levels of social organization, change and agency.</p>

<p>We <strong>like</strong> art too.</p>
