    <strong>Paul Bucci</strong></a>
    is a new media artist whose work currently engages with the veracity of
    abstract modelling and self-projection. This includes a study of avatars,
    symbolic and linguistic abstractions, and meaningful equivalences.

    <strong>Rhys Edwards</strong></a>
    is an artist, writer, and editor. His painting practice blends ambiguous subject matter with pictorial realism to generate uncanny imagery.

  <li>
    <strong>Andrew Keech</strong> is a photographic artist. His current work concentrates on probing the co-constructive relationships between people, technology, and society to discover their hidden myopia.

    <a href="http://www.onzo.ca/statement/" text-decoration="none"
    target="_blank"><strong>Ridia Onzo</strong></a>
    is a performance art, photography, and installation artist. Several of his
    works aim to explore the interplay of language and other coded systems of
    vernacular cognizance through an attentiveness to space and the objects
    that regulate them. He will often explore such environments through a
    self-aware ritualism of his presence as artist.

    <a href="http://paulinepetit.ca/about/index.html" text-decoration="none"
    target="_blank"><strong>Pauline Petit</strong></a>
    is a photographer and digital media artist. Her work currently focuses on
    the narrative vernacular and how it shapes constructed images of not only
    cultures but also personal experiences. Closeness to the subjects allows
    the deconstruction of confining, reassuring representations to explore more
    thoughtfully the issues at hand.
