    <strong>Paul Bucci</strong></a>
    is a new media artist whose work currently engages with the veracity of
    abstract modelling and self-projection. This includes a study of avatars,
    symbolic and linguistic abstraction, and meaningful equivalence
  </li>
  <li><strong>Cass Elliott</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Rhys Edwards</strong> is an artist, writer, and editor. His painting practice blends ambiguous subject matter with pictorial realism to generate uncanny imagery.</li>
  <li><strong>Andrew Keech</strong> is a photographic artist. His current work concentrates on probing the co-constructive relationships between people, technology, and society to discover their hidden myopia.</li>
  <li><strong>Ridia Onzo</strong> is a performance art, photography, and installation artist. Several of his works aim to explore the interplay of language and other coded systems of vernacular cognizance through an attentiveness to space and the objects that regulate them. He will often explore such environments through a self-aware ritualism of his presence as artist.</li>
  <li><strong>Pauline Petit</strong> is a photographer and digital media artist. Her work currently focuses on the narrative vernacular and how it shapes constructed images of not only cultures but also personal experiences. Closeness to the subjects allows the deconstruction of confining, reassuring representations to explore more thoughtfully the issues at hand.</li>
