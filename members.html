Ridia Onzo is a performance art, photography, and installation artist. Several of his works aim to explore the interplay of language and other coded systems of vernacular cognizance through an attentiveness to space and the objects that regulate them. He will often explore such environments through a self-aware ritualism of his presence as artist.

Pauline Petit is a photographer and digital media artist. Her work currently focuses on the narrative vernacular and how it shapes constructed images of not only cultures but also personal experiences. Closeness to the subjects allows the deconstruction of confining, reassuring representations to explore more thoughtfully the issues at hand.
